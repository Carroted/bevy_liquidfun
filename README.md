### ðŸš¨WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESSðŸš¨
This crate is a work in progress and version changes may introduce breaking changes without warning, even in minor version number releases.

# bevy_liquidfun
A Bevy friendly wrapper of Box2D and LiquidFun.

This crate wraps [libliquidfun-sys](https://github.com/mmatvein/libliquidfun-sys) to integrate Box2D and LiquidFun with the [Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

### Remarks
- The library is not fully featured yet. It has been developed with the needs of our game in mind, so the implemented features reflect what we've needed. Early on "Example Driven Development" was used, by porting over regular Box2D examples.
- Feedback on the APIs, usability & overall code quality is very welcome.
- Pull Requests are welcome, but this crate is very much a work in progress alongside our game, so we need full ownership of what goes into the codebase.
